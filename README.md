# Bluetooth Wearable Device Dataset
This repository contains metadata and usage examples of radio recordings from wearable devices, captured using SDR in an RF isolated environment. The raw data recordings can be accessed from [https://pubfaili.edi.lv](https://pubfaili.edi.lv:58043/s/FdpdFERkGXpCc2X) . Each recording is accompanied by its own metadata file (top.yaml), detailing its production process and parameters and JSON file which contains decoded bits and information regarding its Bluetooth parameters.

## Example usage
This repository provides two usage examples tailored to visualize the dataset. For practical demonstrations, smaller sample files are located within the _example_radio_data/ folder. These 2 useage examples will also work with the rest of the dataset.
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 plot_data.py /path/to/top.yaml
python3 demodulated_data.py
```
The first example demonstrates the visualization of physical waveforms from the dataset. 
```console
$ python3 plot_data.py _example_radio_data/top.yaml 
Choose a file to load:
1. Channels_05 data (Channelized 5 MHz Bandwidth)
2. Channels_25 data (Channelized 25 MHz Bandwidth)
3. Output Recording (Not Channelized)
Enter the number corresponding to the file you want to load: 3
Data From _example_radio_data/./radio.data loaded.
Sample Rate: 100000000
Center Frequency: 2441500000
Recording Duration: 0.003 seconds
BD_ADDR of Wearable Device: None
Connection Timestamps:
- Enabling bluetooth on smartphone: None seconds
- Disconnected: None seconds
Enter the start time (in seconds): 0
Enter the stop time (in seconds): 0.003
```

The second example showcases demodulated and decoded results extracted from the radio recordings within the dataset. It will search whole dataset for JSON files and promt user to pick one of them.

While providing valuable insights into the wireless traffic, it's important to note that we used our own methods to decode the data and the results may not fully represent all traffic present. For instance, PSK demodulation, commonly used by Bluetooth devices, is not done in our processing and thus not included in the results.

```console
$ python3 demodulated_data.py
Select a JSON file to load:
1. ./_example_radio_data/_example_recording.json
Enter the number corresponding to the file you want to load: 1
Number of all packets: 4423

Enter the packet number you want to load (or 'q' to quit): 100
